# Cost-of-Living-Analysis

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project focuses on analyzing the cost of living across various cities and countries worldwide using Power BI. The dataset includes a wide range of economic indicators such as housing, transportation, groceries, and entertainment that directly affect the cost of living. The primary goal is to uncover regional economic disparities and provide insightful visualizations to help users understand the global economic landscape.

PROJECT SCOPE

The project includes the following key stages:

âœ… Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

âœ… Building interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI.

âœ… Visualizing and interpreting the cost breakdown across different regions.

âœ… Deriving actionable insights to aid decision-making.

 KEY INSIGHTS

 The Power BI dashboard provides answers to:

âœ… The top 10 most and least expensive cities globally.

âœ… Breakdown of expenses: Housing vs Groceries vs Transportation.

âœ… Regional comparison: Developed vs Developing countries.

âœ… Cost-to-income ratio analysis.
